## Course overview:

Neuroscientists increasingly rely on openly-accessible data and on advanced
methodological procedures for their investigations. Data science offers a key
set of tools and methods to efficiently analyze, visualize, and interpret
neuroscience data. Concurrently, there is a growing concern in the life sciences
that many results produced are difficult or even impossible to reproduce,
commonly referred to as the “reproducibility crisis.”

This course — QLSC-612,
[Fundamentals for Neuro Data Science](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2022-2023/courses/qlsc-612)
— brings together software and analytical tools and methods in order to teach
students how to best use the fundamentals of data science in their daily work to
produce reproducible results. We will take examples in neuroimaging and see how
to use computational tools, statistical and machine learning techniques, and
collaborative, open science methodologies to generate results that are
statistically robust and computationally reproducible. The course also serves as
the first week of the
[Montreal BrainHack School](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/) organized across
Université de Montréal, McGill, Concordia and Polytechnique. The course builds
on the [ReproNim](https://www.repronim.org/) materials for reproducible
neuroimaging research.

## Objective, scope, and intended audience

QLSC-612 is intended for researchers in the life sciences (neurologists,
psychiatrists, psychologists, neuroscientists) who wish to improve their
research practices, or other researchers who want an introduction to data
science with examples in neuroscience and neuroimaging. At the end of the
course, students will be able to analyze neuroscience and neuroimaging data in a
reproducible and collaborative manner using the Python software stack (a popular
and rapidly growing contender in the landscape of neuroscience data analysis).

Amongst the topics, we will cover both the fundamentals of tools (bash, git,
github, jupyter, docker, visualization) and analysis methods (hypothesis
testing, machine learning) at the conceptual and practical levels. See
objectives of each module [here](./lectures-materials.html).

In terms of requirements, students will be expected to have basic programming
skills (such as minimal experience in a scripting language).

## Course modules:

1. Introduction to Reproducibility
2. Terminal and Bash
3. Introduction to Python
4. Intro to NumPy and SciPy
5. Git and GitHub
6. Data Wrangling with Pandas
7. Classical statistics pitfalls and remedies
8. Machine Learning 1: Supervised Learning
9. Machine Learning 2: Model Selection & Validation
10. Introduction to Data Visualization
11. Containers
12. High Performance Computing

## Approach to teaching

This year, we will be returning to in-person learning! Students taking the
course for credit will have to attend lectures in room 189 (QLS Conference Room)
of 550 Sherbrooke Street W. Students will be required to attend in-person
lectures for all of the modules and will have access to
[lectures materials and online content](https://neurodatascience.github.io/QLS612-Overview/lectures-materials.html)
to better consolidate the material. Course grading will be based on the results
of 2 in-person quizzes (see
[schedule](https://neurodatascience.github.io/QLS612-Overview/tut-schedule.html)).
The course requires that you have a laptop and instructions for installation are
[here](https://neurodatascience.github.io/QLS612-Overview/setup.html).
