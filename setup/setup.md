# Setup Instructions

## General computing requirements

There are a few computing requirements for the course that are absolutely
necessary (beyond the few software packages we would like you to install,
described below):

1. You must have administrator access to your computer (i.e., you must be able
   to install things yourself without requesting IT approval).
1. You must have at least 40 GB of free disk space on your computer (but we
   would recommend more, to be safe).
1. If you are using Windows you must be using Windows 10 or 11; Windows 7 and 8
   will not be sufficient for this course.

If you foresee any of these being a problem, please reach out to one of the
instructors (or use the `#help-installation` channel in the QLS612 Slack) for
what steps you can take to ensure you are ready for the course start.

## Required software

To get the most out of our course, we ask that you arrive with the following
software **already installed** (or to the best of your ability):

- A command-line shell: Bash
- A version control system: Git
- A remote-capable text editor: VSCode
- Python 3 via Miniconda
- A virtualization system: Docker
- A GitHub account
- Slack
- Zoom
- A modern browser

The rest of this page provides more detail on installation procedures for each
of the above programs, with separate instructions for each of the three major
operating systems (Windows, Mac OS, and Linux).

### Some quick general notes on instructions

- There is no difference between `Enter` and `Return` in these instructions, so
  just press whatever the equivalent on your keyboard is whenever one is stated
- If you already have some of these things installed on your computer already
  that should (theoretically) be okay.
  - However, for example, having multiple different Python installations on your
    computer can lead to incredibly frustrating issues that are very difficult
    to debug. As such, if you have already installed Python via some other
    application (not Miniconda/Anaconda), we strongly encourage you to uninstall
    it before following the instructions below. You _must_ have Python installed
    via Miniconda for this course.

### OS-specific installation instructions

Select the link that corresponds to your operating system and follow the
instructions therein. Please direct any questions to the `#help-installation`
channel in the QLS612 Slack.

- [Mac](./mac.html)
- [Windows](./windows.html)

### GitHub account

Go to [https://github.com/join/](https://github.com/join/) and follow the
on-screen instructions to create an account. It is a good idea to associate this
with your university e-mail (if you have one) as this will entitle you to sign
up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
which comes with some nice free bonuses.

### Slack

Go to [https://slack.com/downloads/](https://slack.com/downloads/) and download
and install Slack.

### Zoom

Go to [https://zoom.us/download](https://zoom.us/download) and download and
install the Zoom client.

### Modern web browser

Install Firefox, Chrome, or Safari.
