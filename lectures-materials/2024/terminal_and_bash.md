**Instructor:** [Brent McPherson](https://github.com/bcmcpher), [Alyssa Dai](https://github.com/alyssadai)

## Outline

To follow most of the other modules, you will have to have some basic understanding of the command line.
In this module we'll take a look at the the BourneAgainSHell (BASH),
the default command line in most Linux systems.

You will learn how to:

-   move around on your computer with the command line, create and open directories and files
-   find things with the command line (files and programs, PATH variables)
-   run useful command line programs and find help (`find`, `grep`, `ls`, and `man` / documentation)

## Questions you will be able to answer after taking this module

-   What is a command line shell?

-   How would you copy thousands of files with file names starting with `"my_good_file..."`
    to a different directory on your computer?

-   Among thousands of files and directories you know there is one
    where you wrote down `"location of my thesis backup"`. How do you find this file?

-   What is an environment variable, and how can you change it?
