# Intro to reproducibility

**Instructor:** [JB Poline](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/jean-baptiste-poline-phd)

## Outline

With this lecture, you will get a general introduction to reproducible - or irreproducible - life sciences.

Specifically, you will:

- learn what is meant by reproducibility of research results in the life sciences
- understand the main causes for irreproducible results
- learn the possible collective and individual actions for curbing irreproducibility

## Questions you will be able to answer after taking this module

- Is the term "replicability" generally applied to obtaining the same results with another (new) dataset ?
- Is the root cause of irreproducibility the publication incentive ?
- What is a similar result with the same methodology or pipeline but different data ?
