## Outline

-   Data visualization is an essential skill for scientists.

-   At the grad student level, you're probably already familiar with basic plots
    (for example, bar plot vs pie chart), as well as types of data (e.g, ordered vs categorical).

    into the technicalities of planning and executing and effictive Figure.
