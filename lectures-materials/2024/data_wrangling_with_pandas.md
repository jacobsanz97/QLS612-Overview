## Outline

This module is designed to introduce students to the Pandas Python library
for manipulating data in tables and time series
(not to be confused with the [bear of the same name](https://mcdn.wallpapersafari.com/medium/8/55/Wv7BhD.jpg)).

It aims to build a basic understanding of what happens underneath the hood in Pandas,
and arm you with the essential practical knowledge
to fearlessly tackle the next CSV file you encounter in the wild.
